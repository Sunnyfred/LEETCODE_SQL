A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string. 通配符

Wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.


%	         Represents zero or more characters	                      bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_	         Represents a single character	                          h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	       Represents any single character within the brackets	    h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
^	         Represents any character not in the brackets	            h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	         Represents a range of characters	                        c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
