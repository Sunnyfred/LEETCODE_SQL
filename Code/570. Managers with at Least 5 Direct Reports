The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+


Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+

Note:
No one would report to himself.


A:
select e2.name from employee e1
join employee e2 on e2.Id = e1.ManagerId
group by e2.name having count(e2.name)>=5

or 

SELECT Name FROM Employee WHERE Id IN 
(SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(*) > 4);
