Q:

(drop table if exists follow;
Create table If Not Exists follow (
    followee char(200),
    follower char(200));
Truncate table follow;
 
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('A', 'B');
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('B', 'C');
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('B', 'D');
insert into follow (followee, follower) values ('D', 'E');)

In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.

For example:
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+


should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+

Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B’s follower is C and D, and D’s follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower’s alphabet order.


A:

SELECT f1.follower, COUNT(DISTINCT f2.follower) AS num FROM
follow AS f1 JOIN follow AS f2 ON f1.follower = f2.followee
GROUP BY f1.follower ORDER BY f1.follower;
