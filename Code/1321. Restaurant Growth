Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

The query result format is in the following example:

Return result table ordered by visited_on.

average_amount should be rounded to 2 decimal places, all dates are in the format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

+--------------+--------------+----------------+

1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

A:

SELECT t1.visited_on, sum(t2.amount) amount, ROUND(SUM(t2.amount)/7.0, 2) average_amount
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT visited_on FROM customer
WHERE visited_on >= DATE_ADD((SELECT min(visited_on) FROM customer), INTERVAL 6 DAY)) t1
LEFT JOIN
customer t2
ON t1.visited_on <= DATE_ADD(t2.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND t1.visited_on >= t2.visited_on
GROUP BY t1.visited_on;
