Q:

(drop table if exists survey_log;
Create table If Not Exists survey_log (
       uid int,  
       action varchar(255), 
       question_id int, 
       answer_id varchar(255),
       q_num int,
       timestamp int);
 
Truncate table survey_log;
insert into survey_log (uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp) values ('5', 'show', '285', 'null', '1', '123');
insert into survey_log (uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp) values ('5', 'answer', '285', '124124', '1', '124');
insert into survey_log (uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp) values ('5', 'show', '369', 'null', '2', '125');
insert into survey_log (uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp) values ('5', 'skip', '369', 'null', '2', '126');
)

Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

uid means user id; action has these kind of values: “show”, “answer”, “skip”; answer_id is not null when action column is “answer”, while is null for “show” and “skip”; q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| uid  | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+

Output
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+

Explanation

question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number’s ratio in show number in the same question.

A:

select question_id as survey_log from 
(select question_id, 
        sum(if(action='show', 1, 0)) as num_show, 
        sum(if(action='answer', 1, 0)) as num_answer 
 from survey_log group by question_id) t
 group by (num_answer/num_show) desc limit 1;
