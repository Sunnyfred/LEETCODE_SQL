Q:
Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.



A:
DELETE P FROM Person P, Person P2
WHERE P.Email = P2.Email AND P.Id > P2.Id

or 

DELETE p FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN (SELECT MIN(p2.Id) AS 'Id', p2.Email
           FROM Person p2
           GROUP BY p2.Email) group_email
ON p.Id = group_email.Id
WHERE group_email.Email IS NULL
