Q:

(drop table if exists point_2d;
Create table If Not Exists point_2d (
    x int,
    y int);
Truncate table point_2d;
 
insert into point_2d (x, y) values ('-1', '-1');
insert into point_2d (x, y) values ('0', '0');
insert into point_2d (x, y) values ('-1', '-2');)

Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

x  	y
-1	-1
0	  0
-1	-2
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:

shortest
1.00
Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.



A:

SELECT round(sqrt(min(pow((p1.x-p2.x),2)+pow((p1.y-p2.y),2))),2)
FROM point_2d AS p1, point_2d AS p2
where p1.x<>p2.x or p1.y<>p2.y
