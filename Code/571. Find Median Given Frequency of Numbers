Q:

(drop table if exists numbers;
Create table If Not Exists Numbers (
       Number int, 
       Frequency int);
 
Truncate table Numbers;
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('0', '7');
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('1', '1');
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('2', '3');
insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('3', '1');)

The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

Number	Frequency
0	7
1	1
2	3
3	1

In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

median
0.0000



A:

SELECT AVG(NUMBER) as median FROM NUMBERS N
WHERE N.FREQUENCY >= abs((select sum(frequency) from numbers where number <= n.number)-(select sum(frequency) from numbers where number >= n.number))
;
