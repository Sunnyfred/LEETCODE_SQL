Q:

(drop table if exists student;
Create table If Not Exists student (name varchar(50), continent varchar(7));
Truncate table student;
 
insert into student (name, continent) values ('Jane', 'America');
insert into student (name, continent) values ('Pascal', 'Europe');
insert into student (name, continent) values ('Xi', 'Asia');
insert into student (name, continent) values ('Jack', 'America');)

A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The studentsâ€™ location information are stored in table student as below.
name	     continent
Jack	     America
Pascal	   Europe
Xi	       Asia
Jane	     America

Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. 
The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.

For the sample input, the output is:
America	   Asia	    Europe
Jack	     Xi	      Pascal
Jane		

Follow-up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, can you write a query to generate the student report?

A:

select * from student;
SELECT America.name as America, Asia.name as Asia, Europe.name as Europe
from 
(
select name, @a := @a + 1 as ID from student, (select @a := 0) t
  where continent = 'America' order by name
) America
left join
(
select name, @b := @b + 1 AS ID from student, (select @b := 0) t
  where continent = 'Asia' order by name
) Asia on Asia.ID = America.ID
left join 
(
select name, @c := @c + 1 AS ID from student, (select @c := 0) t
  where continent = 'Europe' order by name
) Europe on Europe.ID = Asia.ID;
